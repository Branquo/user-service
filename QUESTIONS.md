# Organisational 

> - [ ] What is your prefered start date?  
I can start any time.

>- [ ] How many hours / week?  
I prefer ~20 hours / week, but I can be flexible as long as I have time for university.

> - [ ] Contractor or Employee?  
I prefer being employed. Freelancing could also work, but really depends on the conditions. 

>- [ ] What is your expectation regarding salary?  
I am targeting an annual salary in the range of â‚¬ 55.000 (full time equivalent position)

> - [ ] Do you need office space, or will you work remote?  
I have a full setup at home in a dedicated room (office), so I can work remote.

> - [ ] Do you have hardware you enjoy working with?
>   - [ ] If so, is your hardware properly encrypted?  
My hardware is currently not encrypted, but I would add dedicated encrypted hard drives for a work environment. (and other necessary methods)

> - [ ] Is it ok for you to sign third party NDAs?  
No problem.

> - [ ] Any other questions?  
What will the projects be about? What will my main tasks be? Will I work mostly on my own project or will I collaborate with others?  
What are the next steps in this application process?

# Project questions

> - [ ] Are there questions regarding the task?  
Not really. I just want to remark, that I didn't implement the `audit log`, simply because I didn't want to spend too much more time, but I just want to make clear that I would be able to do it. (implement middleware logaudit function that inserts into audit table, integrate it in routes (some extra user fetching may me necessary for some routes, e.g. delete /users/:id), convert row data to JSON, proceed with all routes)

> - [ ] Are there questions regarding the code review comments?  
I am not exactly sure what this means. I assume there may be a code review stage in this application process and I may have to review these comments..?

# Personal preferences

> - [ ] What do you enjoy working with, what do you dislike/avoid?  
Likes: So far, I enjoyed using node.js and express.js. I also like using Svelte, it was quite easy to pick up on and feels very logical. I also like learning new stuff, in general.  
Dislikes: I feel like the most challenges I've had so far was deploying apps and make them work externally. Probably because I am used to running code mostly locally. The deployment was also the most time consuming part in this project.

> - [ ] Why did you quit your previous jobs?  
There was no room for growth anymore and I want to focus on web development.

> - [ ] Tell me about your most exciting project of the past  
This sounds a bit cheesy, but my most exciting project of the past (related to software development) was probably the diploma work I did at the end of HTL, where my friends and I developed an android game in unity. I loved learning all these new technologies and it was the first time I collabed with people and the road to the final product was really exciting, seeing it all come together. 

> - [ ] What do you look into in code reviews?  
First of all, that it is correct (obviously), if it is readable (proper use of variable and function names, use of comments), proper use of modularity, etc

> - [ ] What is proper code for you?  
proper code is readable, efficient, documented, testable, secure etc

# MISC
> - [ ] Do you have experience with crypto primitives (e.g. AES-GCM, RSA)?  
no, not hands on. I only know how they work theoretically.

> - [ ] Do you have experience with Svelte or similar SPAs?  
yes, Svelte, AngularJS, Ember.js and touched some others
