# Personal preferences

Likes: So far, I enjoyed using node.js and express.js. I also like using Svelte, it was quite easy to pick up on and feels very logical. I also like learning new stuff, in general.
Dislikes: I feel like the most challenges I've had so far was deploying apps and make them work externally. Probably because I am used to running code mostly locally. The deployment was also the most time consuming part in this project.
> - [ ] What do you enjoy working with, what do you dislike/avoid?

There was no room for growth anymore and I want to focus on web development.
> - [ ] Why did you quit your previous jobs?

This sounds a bit cheesy, but my most exciting project of the past (related to software development) was probably the diploma work I did at the end of HTL, where my friends and I developed an android game in unity. I loved learning all these new technologies and it was the first time I collabed with people and the road to the final product was really exciting, seeing it all come together. 
> - [ ] Tell me about your most exciting project of the past

First of all, that it is correct (obviously), if it is readable (proper use of variable and function names, use of comments), proper use of modularity, etc
> - [ ] What do you look into in code reviews?

proper code is readable, efficient, documented, testable, secure etc
> - [ ] What is proper code for you?

# MISC
no, not hands on. I only know how they work theoretically.
> - [ ] Do you have experience with crypto primitives (e.g. AES-GCM, RSA)?

yes
> - [ ] Do you have experience with Svelte or similar SPAs?
